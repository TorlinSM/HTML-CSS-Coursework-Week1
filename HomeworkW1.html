                A globally consistent local-scale assessment of future tropical cyclone risk

                    Tropical cyclones (TCs) are responsible for the highest insured losses of any natural hazard, exceeding $480 billion in the United States alone over 
                    the last decade (1). TCs are projected to become more intense in a warming climate (2), enhancing the risks associated with their wind speeds, 
                    precipitation, storm surges, and waves (3, 4). TC losses have shown to rise steeply and nonlinearly with increasing intensity (5–9). Moreover, 
                    TC losses can vary greatly across spatial scales, with the largest losses often found in more densely populated areas. Hence, to better protect coastal 
                    communities from future TC impacts, it is vital to improve our understanding of future changes in local-scale TC hazards and risk.
                    Future climate TC impact assessments often rely on climate projections from global climate models (GCMs) for specific scenarios of carbon emissions. 
                    However, GCMs provide limited information on how climate extremes such as TCs may change (10, 11), primarily because the spatial resolution of past-generation 
                    GCMs (±1.0°) is insufficient to adequately resolve TC intensity, size, and track (12). Consequently, there is no consensus on the projected change in TC 
                    frequency and characteristics under various climate change scenarios (2), particularly at the local scale. Recently, substantial progress has been made with the 
                    development of high-resolution GCMs (±0.25°) (13). However, these GCMs still struggle to capture the most intense TCs (10), both through continued limitations in 
                    resolution and numerical precision (14) and from parameterizations of convective processes that do not hold for intense TCs, such as the assumption of hydrostatic 
                    balance. In addition, GCM simulations typically only cover 30- to 100-year periods of historical and future climate (13), resulting in a small sample of TCs. 
                    This is an important constraint that further limits the accurate estimation of (changes in) the probability of extreme events in time and in space.

                RESULTS
            </section>
                <h2>
                    Our results show a global-scale increase in the frequency of occurrence of intense TCs (i.e., exceeding category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane 
                    Wind Scale) (26) and a decrease in the frequency of weaker systems such as tropical storms (Fig. 1). We find similar results for the different basins 
                    except the Bay of Bengal (North Indian), where the frequency of intense TCs decreases under climate change. This is in line with results from other 
                    studies using high-resolution (finer than 28 km × 28 km) GCMs (2).
